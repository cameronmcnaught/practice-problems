		<h2>Question 1 - <small>Fibonacci Looping</small></h2>
		<p>
			Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, etc.
			<br />
			By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
		</p>
		<h4>Solution</h4>
		<p>Sum of all even number in the Fibonnacci Sequence is: <span id="q1" style="font-weight: bold"></span></p>

		<h2>Question 2 - <small>Name Scores</small></h2>
		<p>
			Using names.txt (included), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order.
			Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.
			So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
		</p>
		<h4>Solution</h4>
		<p>
			<label for="fileInput">Select a file</label>
			<input type="file" id="fileInput" />
			<div>The sum of all the name scores is: <span id="q2" style="font-weight: bold"></span></div>
